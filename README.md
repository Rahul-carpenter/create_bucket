## AWS S3 Bucket Creation with Python and Boto3 üêç

This repository contains a simple Python script that demonstrates how to create an Amazon S3 bucket using Boto3, the AWS SDK for Python.

### About AWS S3
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a secure, durable, and highly scalable object storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, making it ideal for various use cases such as data backup, static website hosting, data archiving, and more.

### Features
- Creates a new AWS S3 bucket in the specified region using Python and Boto3.
- Generates a unique bucket name using UUID to ensure global uniqueness.
- Simplified Python code with minimal dependencies.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your local machine.
- AWS credentials configured with the necessary permissions to create S3 buckets.
- Boto3 library (`pip install boto3`) and AWS CLI (`pip install awscli`) installed.

### How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `create_bucket.py` in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
3. Replace `'your_bucket_name'` with your desired bucket name in the script.
4. Set your AWS region in the `region` variable (e.g., `'us-west-2'`).
5. Run the script using `python create_bucket.py` in the terminal.

### Note
- Ensure that your AWS credentials are properly configured on your machine before running the script. You can use the AWS CLI (`aws configure`) to set up your credentials.
- Bucket names must be globally unique across all AWS accounts.
